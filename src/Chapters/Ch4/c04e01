01- Functions defined in a class are inlined by default.
02- complex operator+(complex a, complex b) { return a+=b; }
03- public: Vector(std::initializer_list<double>);
04- As is common for abstract classes, Container does not have a constructor.
05- unique_ptr which will delete the object when it is no longer needed,
0that is, when its unique_ptr goes out of scope.
06- Vector(Vector&& a); // move constructor
07-  The && means ‘‘rvalue reference’’ and is a reference to which we can bind an rvalue
08- Shape(Shape&&) =delete; +copy+.. in hierarchy
09- template<typename T>
10- functor
