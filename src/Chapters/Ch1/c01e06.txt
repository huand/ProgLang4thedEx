(âˆ—3) Describe the difference between dynamic (run-time) and static (compile-time) type
checking and outline the strengths and weaknesses of each.

compile time checking: check type compatibility at compile 
time, saving trouble before execution and ensuring coherency
 in the program

dynamic type checking: more flexible but more prone to mistakes?
polymorphism?
